# Tuppers-formula
Java implementation of Tupper's formula with BigInteger in Processing.

[Tupper's self-referential formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper%27s_self-referential_formula) is a formula that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (x, y) plane.

This project was inspired by a Numberphile video, [The 'Everything' Formula](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s5RFgd59ao), featuring Matt Parker.
